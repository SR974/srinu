//1 an abstract method and class should contain abstract keyword

//2 it should contain semicolon
	// 3 abstarct method never contains any method body but in normal method we can write the body 
	// 4 in abstract class we can't create object for class but we can inherit that abstract class
	// 5 it is a partial abstraction
	// 6 if at least one method is an abstract class is also abstract 
// 7 in abstarct class we can write normal methods and static methods from java 1.8 version but in normal class we can't create abstract methods
